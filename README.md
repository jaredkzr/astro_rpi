# Astro_RPI
Turning the Raspberry Pi into an astrophotography camera platform.

This project currently includes a 3D-printable mount for the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera to interface with a 2" telescope focuser and a python program to interface with the camera. 

Features include:

- Easy to use command line interface
- Camera previews
- ISO adjustment
- Full resolution jpg image capture
- Configurable profiles for planetary imaging (currently includes Jupiter and Saturn)

### Media
Using the High Quality Camera, this setup has successfully shot Jupiter and Saturn using a modified 8" dobsonian telescope.
